Okay,
  Hopefully this is a fun one. The
challenge is to write a program to
find the all the factors of the
following numbers:
   1. 3273
   2. 80030004003271
   3. 800300040303271

Now I have supplied an implementation,
but don't look. In fact if you haven't
already done so, do a:
mv src dga_src
Use the dga_src if you need more help
then what is in the hints files.
Certainly you can use the CMakeLists.txt file.
